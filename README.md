# Custom Arduino USB Name

## Description

The app allows you to customize the USB name, manufacturer, and PID (Product ID) for your Arduino board (Leonardo, Micro, ProMicro, Due). It generates the necessary code to modify the `boards.txt` file in the Arduino IDE installation directory.
The app is designed to be user-friendly and does not require any programming knowledge. Simply fill in the form with your desired USB name, manufacturer, and PID, and the app will generate the code for you.

The app also provides a preview of the generated code, so you can see exactly what will be added to the `boards.txt` file. Once you have generated the code, you can copy it to your clipboard and paste it into the `boards.txt` file.

## Features

- **Custom USB Name**: Change the USB name that appears when you connect your Arduino board to your computer.
- **Custom Manufacturer Name**: Set a custom manufacturer name for your Arduino board.
- **Custom PID**: Generate a unique Product ID (PID) for your Arduino board.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The app is designed to be easy to use, with a simple form to fill out.
- **Preview of Generated Code**: See the code that will be added to the `boards.txt` file before you copy it.

## Instructions

1. Close the Arduino IDE if it is open.
2. Locate **and backup** the `boards.txt` file in your Arduino installation directory. This file is usually found in the following path:
   - Windows: `C:\Users\<username>\Documents\ArduinoData\packages\arduino\hardware\avr\1.8.6`
   - macOS: `/Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Java/hardware/arduino/avr/boards.txt`
   - Linux: `/usr/share/arduino/hardware/arduino/avr/boards.txt`
3. Open the `boards.txt` file in a text editor (Visual Studio Code or similar).
4. At the end of the file, add the text copied to clipboard.
5. Save the `boards.txt` file.
6. Open the Arduino IDE and select your board from the Tools > Board menu.
7. Select the correct port from the Tools > Port menu.
8. Upload a sketch to your board to test the new USB name.
9. After uploading, unplug and replug the board to see the new USB name in your operating system's device manager.
10. If you want to revert to the original USB name, simply restore the backup of the `boards.txt` file.

## How the app works

The app works by modifying the `boards.txt` file in the Arduino IDE installation directory. This file contains configuration settings for different Arduino boards, including the USB name. By adding a custom entry to this file, you can change the USB name that appears when you connect your board to your computer.

The script modifies specific lines in the `boards.txt file to customize the USB name, manufacturer, and PID for the Arduino Leonardo or ProMicro board. Here's an explanation of the lines that are modified or added by the script:

Modified or Added Lines in boards.txt

**1. myBoard.name:**

This line sets the name of the board as it appears in the Arduino IDE.
Example:

```myBoard.name=Custom Device Name```

The value is taken from the "Device Name" field in the form.

**2. myBoard.build.usb_product:**

This line sets the USB product name that appears when the board is connected to a computer.
Example:

```plaintext
myBoard.build.usb_product=Custom USB Name
```

The value is also taken from the "Device Name" field in the form.

**3. myBoard.build.usb_manufacturer:**

This line sets the USB manufacturer name that appears when the board is connected to a computer.
Example:

```myBoard.build.usb_manufacturer="Custom Manufacturer"```

The value is taken from the "Manufacturer" field in the form.

**4. myBoard.build.pid:**

This line sets the USB Product ID (PID) for the board.
Example:

```myBoard.build.pid=0x1234```

The PID is autogenerated by the script and displayed in the form.

#### How These Lines Are Used

These lines are added to the boards.txt file under a custom board definition (e.g., myBoard) created by the script.
The Arduino IDE uses these settings to configure the USB name, manufacturer, and PID when uploading a sketch to the board.

#### Why These Lines Are Important

`myBoard.name`: Helps identify the board in the Arduino IDE.

`myBoard.build.usb_product`: Changes the USB name displayed in the operating system's device manager.

`myBoard.build.usb_manufacturer`: Displays the manufacturer name in the operating system's device manager.

`myBoard.build.pid`: Ensures the board has a unique USB Product ID, which is important for distinguishing multiple devices.
